.. note::
   This documentation page is for your own use as you best see fit for your project.

   In some cases it might be enough with the README.md in the project root, 
   however you might use this if you want to publish API documentation, or have a 
   website where you want to make detailed project information available 
   (you can e.g. publish direct from blob storage). The project root README.md 
   is used for the getting-started section in the docs if you choose to build it.
